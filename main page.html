<br>
Reasons behind poor mental health differ depending on different factors. The Main three causes are:
<br>
<br>

<h2 style="color:gold";><strong>Upbringing and environment</strong></h2>

<p style="color:black;">
  Half of human population lives in cities, which arise the priority to create a better environment for healthy surroundings and society. Nontheless, of the government and organisations tries, there still an incraesing exist in social evaluative stress.<br>
    <img src="schock.JPENG" alt="envio" width="200" height="130"> Tests such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI and research like Montreal Image Stress Task MIST have withdrawn a conclusion that congative process with and without stress is different. This was established by comparison of the level of cortisol,heart beats and blood pressure before and after the tests were taken. This study included participants from rural areas, towns, and major cities (see image below).  </p><br>
   
   <br>
    <br>

<h2  style="color: gold";><strong>Life Experience</strong></h2> 
<p style="color:black;"> Recently people is starting recepting the awareness of bad and sad experiences effection on mental health and health in general.<br>
  Dealing with a schocking news, such as death of family or friend, change in parental relationships, growing in homeland of unrest or being bullied, all metioned events and more contributed towards having a downing period of time in life, in which if it is exceeded it can result into any type of mental illness and could reach any level.<img src="an.JPENG" alt="anexity" width="150" height="150"><br></p>
<br>
<br>

<h2  style="color: gold";><strong>Genes and Biomedical Causes</strong></h2><img src="brain.JPENG" alt="brain" width="150" height="150"><br>
<p style="color:black;"> Some mental disorders have links of genetic background, for example Schizophrenia, depresssion and attention deficint hyperactivity disorder. Researches state that some genectic causes are related to the movement of calcium through the brain. Also, they stated that the effect og genetic causes is small. This was a genum-wide association study. <br>
  On top of the above stated study, there are arguments around the genetic tolerance with mental health diseases as arguments recoomend mental health treatment but they do not recognise improvemt probability. There is an increase in the number of patients, whom have been diagnosed with mental issue, that they fear in passing there own disorder to their blood line.<br>
Cause of mental health issues running in families is yet to be proven my researches and studies. </p><br>
<br>
<br>


<h4 style="color: gold";><strong>A Common disoreder</strong></h><img src="q.JPENG" alt="smedia" width="130" height="120"><br>
<p style="color:black;"> There is common raise in cases of Generalised Activity Disorder GAD. A person with GAD can simply get stressed from any new thing event he\she get exposed to. Symptoms are commonly highlighted by suffering from: chronic fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, musceles tenssion and difficulty in sleeping. GAD is very coomon in work places and within students and it can incraese and decrease according to the level preception someones mind and health can handle. Technolog and social media play a negative effect in mental health, as they sometimes have the role to pressurised a person to do something he/she is not comfortable with or not happy. It get worse when the comparison starts. </p><br>
